Remote Scripts for Propellerheads Reason audio software and Livid MIDI Controllers

Installation
------------
Make a backup of your current "Livid" Codec and Maps folders for Reason Remote. These folders are in:
Mac OSX
<hard drive>:/Library/Application Support/Propellerhead Software/Remote/Codecs/Lua Codecs
<hard drive>:/Library/Application Support/Propellerhead Software/Remote/Maps
Windows
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Propellerhead Software\Remote\Codecs\Lua Codecs
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Propellerhead Software\Remote\Maps
An easy way to back them up is to simply make a zip archive of the folders.
Then, install the "Livid" folder in "to Lua Codecs" and "Livid" folder in "to Maps" to replace the current versions.
When you start Reason, you can open the Control Surfaces preference panel and Auto-Detect for the Base controller.
